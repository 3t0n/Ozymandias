What are working:
- First 5 missions
- Main graphics
- Main animations
- City messages

- Resources and workers
- And more!

What are not working:
- Load game

If you want vanilla experience with visual and UI improvements, or want to use save files in base Caesar 3, check [Julius](https://github.com/bvschaik/julius).
If you want additional visual and UI improvements, and don't want to use the original, check [Augustus](https://github.com/Keriew/augustus).
Ozymandias, like Julius and Augustus, requires the original assets (graphics, sounds, etc) from Pharaoh to run.

## Running the game

First, download the game for your platform from the list above.

Alternatively, you can build Ozymandias yourself. Check [Building Julius](doc/BUILDING.md)
for details.

Then you can either copy the game to the Pharaoh folder, or run the game from an independent
folder, in which case the game will ask you to point to the Pharaoh folder.

Note that you must have permission to write in the game data directory as the saves will be
stored there. Also, your game must be patched to last version to use Ozymandias.
